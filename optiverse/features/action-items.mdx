Never lose track of commitments again. Optiverse automatically identifies, extracts, and manages action items from your meetings, creating a seamless workflow from discussion to completion.

## What are Action Items?

Action items are specific, actionable tasks that emerge from meeting discussions. Optiverse's AI identifies these commitments automatically and provides powerful tools to manage them throughout their lifecycle.
