Optiverse's Smart Search revolutionizes how you find information across all your meetings. Powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, it understands context, interprets natural language queries, and delivers precise results from your entire meeting history in seconds.

## What is Smart Search?

Smart Search goes beyond simple keyword matching. It's an intelligent system that:
- **Understands context** and meaning behind your queries
- **Searches semantically** across all meeting content
- **Provides relevant excerpts** with full context
- **Links related information** from different meetings
- **Learns from your search patterns** to improve results
