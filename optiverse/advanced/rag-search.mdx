## Advanced Search Capabilities

### Semantic Understanding

<Warning>
**Beyond Keywords**: RAG search understands meaning and context, not just keyword matches. This enables more natural and precise search experiences.
</Warning>

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Concept Mapping">
    **Intelligent Connections**
    
    **Semantic Relationships:**
    - Understanding synonyms and related terms
    - Connecting concepts across meetings
    - Identifying topic evolution over time
    - Mapping team expertise and interests
    
    **Example Queries:**
    ```
    Query: "What are the main obstacles to our Q4 goals?"
    
    Semantic Understanding:
    - "obstacles" → "blockers", "challenges", "issues", "problems"
    - "Q4 goals" → "fourth quarter objectives", "year-end targets"
    - Context: business planning, performance metrics
    
    Results: Finds relevant content even if exact words weren't used
    ```
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="Context Awareness">
    **Situational Intelligence**
    
    **Contextual Factors:**
    - Meeting type and purpose
    - Participant roles and relationships
    - Project timelines and phases
    - Business context and priorities
    
    **Contextual Search Examples:**
    ```
    Query: "What did John say about the budget?"
    
    Context Considerations:
    - Which John? (if multiple Johns in organization)
    - Which budget? (marketing, engineering, overall)
    - When? (recent discussions vs. historical)
    - Meeting context (planning vs. review meetings)

## Best Practices

### Query Optimization

<Warning>
**Search Efficiency**: Well-crafted queries not only return better results but also perform faster and consume fewer resources.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Specific Queries">
    **Precision Over Breadth**
    ```
    ❌ Vague: "meetings about stuff"
    ✅ Specific: "Q4 budget planning decisions in marketing meetings"
    
    ❌ Too broad: "what happened yesterday"
    ✅ Focused: "action items from yesterday's product review meeting"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Context Inclusion">
    **Provide Relevant Context**
    ```
    ❌ Ambiguous: "What did John say?"
    ✅ Contextual: "What did John say about the API integration timeline in the engineering standup?"
    
    ❌ Unclear: "budget issues"
    ✅ Specific: "budget concerns raised during Q4 planning for the mobile app project"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Filter Utilization">
    **Narrow Search Scope**
    - Use date ranges for time-sensitive queries
    - Apply speaker filters for person-specific searches
    - Utilize meeting type filters for context
    - Employ project tags for focused results
  </Step>
</Steps>
